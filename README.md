## 🎯 The Short Version

```text
Distinguished Engineer & IT Architect who still gets his hands dirty.
VP by title. Builder by nature. Servant leader by philosophy.
```

I've spent 25+ years climbing the tech ladder the hard way — **Level 1 Helpdesk → Developer → Architect → VP** — and I've never forgotten what it's like to be the one on-call at 2 AM. Now I lead global platform teams at Bayer while obsessing over how AI agents will reshape how we build software.

## 💡 Philosophy

> *"Technology is only as good as the people behind it."*

I believe in **servant leadership** — the best architectures come from teams that are empowered, not directed. I've managed enough large-scale failures to know that culture eats strategy for breakfast, and that the person closest to the problem usually has the best solution.

## 🔥 Current Obsessions

- **AI Agent Orchestration** — Building systems where multiple AI agents coordinate through git-based workflows
- **Context Engineering** — Optimizing how we feed information to LLMs for maximum signal
- **The Future of Development** — What does "writing code" even mean when AI writes most of it?

## 🎸 Off the Clock

Learning electric guitar from zero. The goal: play well enough to impress my spouse. The reality: my fingers hurt and my amp is too loud. But hey, that's how you learn anything worth learning.
